:: hello, world ::
my name is daniel, i am no coder wotsoeva, but i'm interested in many things.
i make music & photos, i design stuff, and, occasionally, i explore different open-source projects, sometimes i try to code something (yeah, with absolutely zero knowledge), all in all, broading the horizons.
i dont think i will ever post something on github myself, but i will support creators that bring something new, interesting or beautiful to all of us.

who are you and why are you reading my bio on github...
i dont really think anyone will ever find this lil funny note
but if someone does...
then why and how...

ok byeeee
